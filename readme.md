# Resume Bot
Just a bot to chat with you on my experiences :P

## Demo
http://resumebot.r32.me/

## What can I say to it
The bot process your input using NLP, so give it a try, it might understand you even if the wording is difference from
what I would expect!

The bot also knows the context of the conversation. So, when you are talking about, let's say a project, you can ask
follow-up questions like "what is it about", "what did you do", "what were some challenges", etc.

Here are some sample if you are not sure what you want to say to the bot:
- Tell me about yourself
- Do you know JavaScript?
- What language do you know
- What is Simbrain
    - What did you do in that project
    - What were some challenges
    
And more!
